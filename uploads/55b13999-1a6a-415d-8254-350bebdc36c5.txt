Halliburton Company Profile
What the Company Does
Halliburton is a publicly traded multinational corporation that provides products and services to the upstream oil and gas industry. Its primary focus is on delivering integrated services for exploration, development, and production. Halliburton operates across two main business segments Completion and Production (C&P) and Drilling and Evaluation (D&E).

The C&P segment provides cementing, stimulation, and intervention services to enhance well performance, while the D&E segment offers wellbore placement solutions, logging, and testing services to assess reservoir performance. These services are critical to ensuring the economic viability of hydrocarbon extraction.

Halliburton operates in over 70 countries worldwide, with a significant presence in North America, the Middle East, and Latin America. The company’s major competitors include Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, and Weatherford. Within the oilfield services sector, Halliburton consistently ranks among the top three providers in terms of market share and global reach.

Halliburton's operations are heavily dependent on demand for crude oil and raw natural gas. The company’s performance correlates with exploration and production (E&P) spending, which is influenced by global oil prices.

How the Company Has Performed
The oilfield services sector experienced a turbulent period over the past five years due to fluctuating oil prices. Between 2020 and 2022, the industry faced significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a collapse in oil demand and E&P budgets. Halliburton responded by streamlining its operations and focusing on cost efficiency.

Despite these challenges, Halliburton managed to recover strongly in 2022 and 2023 as global oil prices rebounded. The company has reported steady revenue growth since then, driven by increased upstream activity, especially in North America and the Middle East. Halliburton’s financial performance has been relatively strong compared to its peers, thanks to its robust operational scale and technological advancements.

The company has also focused on diversifying its service offerings to include digital solutions and sustainable energy practices, positioning itself as a leader in innovation within the sector. Its revenue has grown approximately 15% annually since 2022, reflecting a healthy recovery in global E&P spending.
